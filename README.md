# Image Carousel
This repository is my solution to frontendeval's [Image Carousel prompt](https://frontendeval.com/questions/image-carousel).

## Requirements
- [] Fetch images from the [endpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/top/.json?t=all)
- [] Cycle to the next image every 3 seconds
- [] Allow the user to skip to the next/previous image

## Technologies
For my solution, I've chosen to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) with [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/). Vite is incredibly fast and easy to spin up, and can be easily deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for a simple hosting solution.

## Todos
TBD
